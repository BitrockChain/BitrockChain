# Bitrock Chain | Besu 24.3.0

Bitrock is an Ethereum IBFT 2.0 Proof of Authority (PoA) side chain with near-zero native gas fees and lightning speed block times. On top of having a cost-effective, scalable, and high speed infrastructure, Bitrock will have a unique multichain (DEX) swap where cryptocurrencies can be traded directly on their native chains without the need to use DEX's native to those chains, hold native chain tokens, or pay gas fees in those native tokens. All of the former can be handled through Bitrock's native multichain DEX, and all gas is equalized from other chains and paid in native Bitrock.
