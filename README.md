# Bitrock chain

Stealth launched in July of 2023 as a PoA Ethereum side chain with a fully circulating supply, Bitrock boasts an ultra-low cost trading experience coupled with a 1 second block time. Offering high accessibility, a vibrant ecosystem, a robust & secure infrastructure, and numerous key integrations & listings, Bitrock has little to no barriers to entry - positioning it as a favored choice for hosting any type of project or launch.

Bitrock's native official DEX, Rockswap also supports direct multichain transactions across 10+ chains, without the need to use DEXs native to those chains or hold multiple native chain tokens. Rockswap also houses an on-chain Token Builder, cross-chain asset custody, farming, and more.
